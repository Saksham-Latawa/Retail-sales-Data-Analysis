## ✅ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Checked for nulls and duplicates  
- Converted data types (e.g., date columns)  
- Handled outliers using IQR method

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Extracted day, month, year from purchase date  
- Created age groups using binning  
- Calculated revenue metrics  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Age and Gender distribution  
- Top-selling product categories  
- Monthly sales trends  
- Revenue contribution by age group  
- Average order value and customer segmentation  

### 4. Visualizations
- Boxplots for outlier detection  
- Bar charts for categorical comparisons  
- Line plots for time series trends  
- Heatmaps for correlation matrix
